#### Issues
If you have any issues with the applications or the repo, please use the github issue tracker.

Feel also free to suggest fixes and pull requests, especially for the bartsidee.tv modules as they can be updated dynamically. For more information about the BartsideeTV module architecture look [here](https://github.com/bartsidee/bartsidee-boxee/wiki/BartsideeTv-Modules).

If you encounter any problems with any of the apps in the repo, it could be of great help to include your log output with the issue. 

_Settings_    
First make sure you have set the log output to _notice_ level:
_Boxee Main Menu -> Settings -> Advanced -> Debug Level -> Notice_

_Platform_    
For the boxee platforme versions (pc/mac/linux) you can just copy your log from you boxee userdata. You can find the correct directory for your installation [here](http://support.boxee.tv/entries/44149-send-your-userdata-to-boxee-support).

_Boxee Box_    
For the boxee box you can not access the filesystem, so you have to get it from a special debug webpage. In your browser open the following link:    
"Your boxee ip":8080       
    
Press "get latest", and download the latest archive found in the list.

#### Boxee Installer
